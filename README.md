Project Title: Gesture-Controlled Computer Volume Adjustment

Description:
The Gesture-Controlled Computer Volume Adjustment project aims to create a system that allows users to adjust the volume of their computer by making hand gestures. This innovative application leverages computer vision techniques to recognize and interpret specific hand gestures, enabling users to conveniently increase or decrease the volume without physically interacting with the computer.

Components:

OpenCV and Mediapipe: These libraries are utilized for real-time hand detection and tracking. The system captures the video feed from the computer's camera and employs hand landmarks provided by Mediapipe to identify and track the user's hand movements.

Mathematical Calculations: The hypot function from the math module is employed to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points. This distance calculation aids in determining the extent of hand movement, which is crucial for adjusting the volume.

pycaw Library: The pycaw library facilitates interaction with the audio devices on the computer. By using the Core Audio APIs, the project can increase or decrease the volume of the computer's audio output.

Functionality:

Hand Detection: The computer's camera captures the video feed of the user's hand. The system employs hand landmarks to accurately detect the position of the hand in the frame.

Gesture Recognition: Specific hand gestures, such as moving the thumb and index finger closer or farther apart, are recognized as commands for adjusting the volume. By analyzing the distance between key landmarks (e.g., thumb and index finger), the system interprets the user's intention.

Volume Adjustment: Based on the detected gestures, the system communicates with the audio devices using the pycaw library. If the distance between the thumb and index finger increases, the volume is increased, and if it decreases, the volume is decreased accordingly.

Real-time Interaction: The project offers real-time interaction, allowing users to witness immediate volume adjustments as they make the corresponding hand gestures.

Benefits:

Convenience: Users can easily adjust the computer's volume without needing to locate and manipulate physical volume controls.

Hands-free: The gesture-based approach makes the process hands-free, ideal for situations when the user's hands are occupied.

Accessibility: This project can be particularly beneficial for individuals with physical disabilities who might find it challenging to use conventional volume controls.

To RUN THE PROGRAM
OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library is used for real-time computer vision tasks.

To install: Run pip install opencv-python in your command prompt or terminal.
